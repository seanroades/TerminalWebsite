        Ever liked shooting bad guy things??? Same! I wanted to make a cool decentralized game for Decentraland, so I decided to make Zombiegeist, whichc is like Call of Duty Zombies on the blockchain with some twists (like a bus you call in with turrets that shoots zombies) and collectibles.

        This was my first game ever, and it was difficult to get everything perfect--and admittly I didn't, but in the short 2 weeks I had to make it, I thought it turned out to be pretty cool!

        BUILDING NOTES: I coded this in DCL's game engine with blockchain components. Creating blockchain based games seems to be not only a major painpoint for me but others too. If I do something else in this space, it'd likely be something to address this.
